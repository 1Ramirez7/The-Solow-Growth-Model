Notes:
BEA Account Code: A072RC
Personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income (DPI), frequently referred to as "the personal saving rate," is calculated
as the ratio of personal saving to DPI.
Personal saving is equal to personal income less personal outlays and personal taxes; it may generally be viewed as the portion 
of personal income that is used either to provide funds to capital markets or to invest in real assets such as residences.
