# The Solow Growth Model

This model was built and published in **RStudio**, using **R version 4.2.3** as of **April 3, 2025**. It was developed under the assumption that users input valid values for both exogenous and endogenous variables (e.g., a savings rate equal to or greater than 1 will result in division by zero).
