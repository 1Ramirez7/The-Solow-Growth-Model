Load Libraries: Loads necessary R packages for UI, server logic, plotting, and data handling.
1.	UI Setup:
o	Defines a sidebar layout with input controls for simulation parameters, experiments, and data downloads.
o	Creates tabs for different output views (World data, Plots, Log/Ratio Scale, Tables).
2.	Server Setup:
o	Data Import & Selection: Imports Excel data for savings rate and dynamically updates UI selections based on chosen regions/countries.
3.	Experiment iteractive table
o	Experiments Management: Allows users to define experiments and manage them via a reactive table with delete functionality.
4.	Solow-Romer Model Simulation:
o	Defines a function (simulate_solow) to compute economic variables over time with/without experiments.
o	Updates simulation parameters dynamically based on user input.
5.	Reactive Event Handling:
o	Executes simulation upon user request, generating separate outputs for cases with and without experiments.
o	Displays results in tabular format.
6.	Plot Generation:
o	Uses ggplot2 to visualize key economic variables over time.
o	Provides an option to compare cases with and without experiments.
7.	Download Functionality:
o	Allows users to download simulation results as CSV.
o	Saves plots as PNG files and packages them in a ZIP archive for download.
8.	Shiny App Execution:
o	Runs the Shiny app with the defined UI and server logic.
