# App Structure Overview

---

### 📦 Load Libraries  
Loads necessary R packages for UI, server logic, plotting, and data handling.

---

### 1. 🧩 UI Setup  
- Defines a sidebar layout with input controls for simulation parameters, experiments, and data downloads.  
- Creates tabs for different output views:
  - World Data  
  - Plots  
  - Log/Ratio Scale  
  - Tables

---

### 2. 🖥️ Server Setup  

#### Data Import & Selection  
- Imports Excel data for savings rate  
- Dynamically updates UI selections based on chosen regions/countries

---

### 3. 🧪 Experiment Interactive Table  

#### Experiments Management  
- Allows users to define experiments  
- Manages them via a reactive table with delete functionality

---

### 4. 📊 Solow–Romer Model Simulation  
- Defines a function (`simulate_solow`) to compute economic variables over time with/without experiments  
- Updates simulation parameters dynamically based on user input

---

### 5. ⚙️ Reactive Event Handling  
- Executes simulation upon user request  
- Generates separate outputs for cases with and without experiments  
- Displays results in tabular format

---

### 6. 📈 Plot Generation  
- Uses **ggplot2** to visualize key economic variables over time  
- Provides an option to compare cases with and without experiments

---

### 7. 💾 Download Functionality  
- Allows users to download simulation results as CSV  
- Saves plots as PNG files and packages them in a ZIP archive for download

---

### 8. 🚀 Shiny App Execution  
- Runs the Shiny app with the defined UI and server logic
